# Return Product Functionality Documentation

## Overview
A comprehensive return product system that allows customers to return delivered products within 1 day of delivery with a 65% refund policy. The system includes automatic eligibility validation, admin approval workflow, and complete refund processing.

## Features Implemented

### üéØ Core Business Logic

## Testing Recommendations

### üß™ Test Scenarios
1. **Eligibility Testing**:
   - Test with orders delivered within 24 hours
   - Test with orders delivered more than 24 hours ago
   - Test with already returned items

2. **Workflow Testing**:
   - Create return request ‚Üí Admin approval ‚Üí Pickup ‚Üí Receipt ‚Üí Refund
   - Test rejection workflow with admin comments
   - Test cancellation by customer

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Multiple items in single return request
   - Partial quantity returns
   - Concurrent return requests
   - System downtime during return window

### üìä Performance Considerations
- Database indexing on delivery dates for quick eligibility checks
- Caching of eligible items for frequent access
- Pagination for admin return request listings
- Background jobs for automatic return window expiry

# Discounted Price Implementation

## Overview
Added a `discountedPrice` field to the Product model that automatically calculates and stores the discounted price based on the original price and discount percentage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Product Model (`product.model.js`)
- Added `discountedPrice` field to store the calculated discounted price
- Added pre-save middleware to automatically calculate discounted price when saving
- Added static method `calculateDiscountedPrice()` for manual calculations
- Added instance method `getEffectivePrice()` to get the best available price

### 2. Product Controller (`product.controller.js`)
- Updated `updateProductDetails()` to calculate discounted price when price or discount is updated
- Existing `createProductController()` automatically uses the pre-save middleware

### 3. Frontend (`PartialCancellationModal.jsx`)
- **PRIORITY 1**: Uses stored `discountedPrice` from `item.productId.discountedPrice` (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- **PRIORITY 2**: Uses stored `discountedPrice` from `item.productDetails.discountedPrice`
- **PRIORITY 3**: Falls back to `item.productDetails.finalPrice`
- **PRIORITY 4**: Size-adjusted pricing with discounts
- **PRIORITY 5**: Regular price calculation with discounts
- **PRIORITY 6**: Order-level discounts (coupons, promos)
- Added comprehensive debugging to track price calculation sources
- Enhanced debug information in development mode

### 4. Database Migration (`updateDiscountedPrices.js`)
- Utility script to update all existing products with calculated discounted prices

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**

### **Recent Updates Made:**

1. **✅ Database Migration Completed**
   - Successfully updated 9 products with discounted prices
   - White TShirt: ₹400 → ₹380 (5% discount)
   - Royal Blue Tshirt: ₹500 → ₹470 (6% discount)  
   - Pink Tshirt: ₹600 → ₹576 (4% discount)

2. **✅ Backend API Updates**
   - Updated all populate statements in `order.controller.js` to include `discountedPrice`
   - `getUserOrdersController()` - Now returns discounted price for order listings
   - `getOrderByIdController()` - Now returns discounted price for individual orders
   - `getAllOrdersController()` - Now returns discounted price for admin panel
   - Server restarted to apply changes

3. **✅ Frontend Priority Logic**
   - Cancel order modal now prioritizes `item.productId.discountedPrice`
   - Enhanced debug logging shows which price source is being used
   - Development mode displays all available price sources

### **Expected Results:**
After these updates, the "Select Items to Cancel" section should now display:
- **White TShirt**: ₹380.00 (instead of ₹400.00)
- **Royal Blue Tshirt**: ₹470.00 (instead of ₹500.00)
- **Pink Tshirt**: ₹576.00 (instead of ₹600.00)

### **Testing Instructions:**
1. Go to **My Orders** page
2. Click **Cancel Order** on any order
3. Select **Cancel specific items**
4. Check if prices now show discounted amounts
5. Open browser console (F12) to see debug logs confirming price source

### Running the Migration (One-time)
```bash
cd server
node utils/updateDiscountedPrices.js
```

### How It Works

1. **New Products**: When creating a product, the discounted price is automatically calculated and saved
2. **Updating Products**: When updating price or discount, the discounted price is recalculated
3. **Frontend Display**: The frontend now checks for `discountedPrice` first, then falls back to manual calculation

### Example Product Structure
```json
{
  "name": "Blue T-Shirt",
  "price": 500,
  "discount": 20,
  "discountedPrice": 400,  // Automatically calculated (500 - 20%)
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Price Priority in Frontend (Cancel Order Modal)
1. `item.productId.discountedPrice` (✅ **HIGHEST PRIORITY** - Uses stored discounted price from product model)
2. `item.productDetails.discountedPrice` (✅ **SECOND PRIORITY** - Alternative source for discounted price)
3. `item.productDetails.finalPrice` (Fallback for legacy data)
4. Size-adjusted pricing with discounts
5. Regular price calculation with discounts
6. Order-level discounts (coupons, promos)

**Note**: The cancel order modal now prioritizes the stored `discountedPrice` field from the product model, ensuring consistent and accurate discount display.

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: No need to calculate discounts on every request
2. **Consistency**: Same discounted price across all parts of the application
3. **Accuracy**: Centralized discount calculation logic
4. **Debugging**: Clear price source tracking in frontend

## Testing

1. Create a new product with a discount
2. Verify `discountedPrice` is automatically calculated
3. Update the discount percentage
4. Verify `discountedPrice` is recalculated
5. Check the cancellation modal shows correct discounted prices

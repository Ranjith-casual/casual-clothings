// Time-based refund policy
const refundPercentages = {
  within24Hours: 90,    // 90% refund

     ↓
REFUND_INITIATED → REFUND_PROCESSING → REFUND_SUCCESSFUL
```

## 🎣 Enhanced Webhook Integration

### **Supported Webhook Events**
```javascript
// Your webhook endpoint handles these events:
- payment.captured   → Update order as paid
- payment.failed     → Mark payment as failed
- refund.created     → Set status to REFUND_PROCESSING
- refund.processed   → Set status to REFUND_SUCCESSFUL  
- refund.failed      → Set status to REFUND_FAILED
```

### **Webhook Security**
- ✅ Signature verification using webhook secret
- ✅ Idempotency handling for duplicate events
- ✅ Comprehensive error logging

## 📈 Admin Dashboard Integration

### **Refund Management Panel**
```javascript
// Example frontend integration
const RefundManager = {
  async processRefund(orderId, amount, reason) {
    const response = await fetch('/api/payment/refund/complete', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${adminToken}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ orderId, refundAmount: amount, reason })
    });
    return response.json();
  },

  async getRefundAnalytics(period) {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/payment/refund/analytics?${period}`);
    return response.json();
  }
};
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Refund System

```bash
cd /home/gowtham/Development/casual-clothings/server
node test-refunds.js
```

### **2. Test Individual Components**
```javascript
// Test complete refund
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/payment/refund/complete \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \

## Refund Process Flow

### 1. Customer Requests Cancellation
- Customer initiates order cancellation
- System calculates refund amount based on cancellation policy
- Admin reviews and approves/rejects the request

### 2. Refund Initiation
- **Manual Process**: Admin initiates refund through admin panel
- **Automatic Process**: System automatically processes approved cancellations

### 3. Razorpay Processing
- Refund request sent to Razorpay
- Razorpay processes the refund (typically instant for cards, 5-7 days for bank transfers)
- Webhooks notify your system of refund status updates

## Available Endpoints

### 1. Initiate Razorpay Refund
```
POST /api/payment/razorpay/refund
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
Body: {
  "paymentId": "pay_xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "amount": 1500,
  "notes": {
    "reason": "Customer cancellation",
    "orderId": "ORD-xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }
}
```

### 2. General Refund Initiation
```
POST /api/payment/refund/initiate
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
Body: {
  "paymentId": "pay_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

### 3. Complete Refund Process
```
POST /api/payment/refund/complete
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
Body: {
  "orderId": "ORD-xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "refundAmount": 1500,
  "adminNotes": "Refund completed successfully"
}
```

## Refund Types

### 1. Full Refund
```javascript
// Refund the entire payment amount
const refundAmount = order.totalAmt;
```

### 2. Partial Refund
```javascript
// Refund based on cancellation policy
const refundPercentage = 75; // 75% refund
const refundAmount = (order.totalAmt * refundPercentage) / 100;
```

### 3. Multiple Partial Refunds
```javascript
// For orders with multiple items cancelled separately
const itemRefundAmount = (item.price * refundPercentage) / 100;
```

## Refund Status Tracking

### Order Status Updates
- `REFUND_INITIATED` - Refund request sent to Razorpay
- `REFUND_PROCESSING` - Razorpay is processing the refund
- `REFUND_SUCCESSFUL` - Refund completed successfully
- `REFUND_FAILED` - Refund failed (requires manual intervention)

### Database Fields
```javascript
refundDetails: {
  refundId: "rfnd_xxxxxxxxxxxxx",      // Razorpay refund ID
  refundAmount: 1500,                   // Amount refunded
  refundPercentage: 75,                 // Percentage of original amount
  refundDate: "2025-08-07T10:30:00Z",  // When refund was processed
  retainedAmount: 500                   // Amount retained by merchant
}
```

## Webhook Integration

### Set Up Webhook Events
In your Razorpay Dashboard, enable these webhook events:
- `refund.created` - When refund is initiated
- `refund.processed` - When refund is completed
- `refund.failed` - When refund fails

### Webhook URL
```
https://yourdomain.com/api/payment/razorpay/webhook
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Refund Policy Implementation
```javascript
// Automatic refund calculation based on time
const calculateRefundPercentage = (orderDate) => {
  const hoursSinceOrder = (Date.now() - new Date(orderDate)) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
  
  if (hoursSinceOrder <= 24) return 90;  // 90% within 24 hours
  if (hoursSinceOrder <= 48) return 75;  // 75% within 48 hours
  return 50; // 50% after 48 hours
};
```

### 2. Refund Validation
```javascript
// Always validate before processing refund
const validateRefund = (order) => {
  if (order.paymentStatus === "REFUNDED") {
    throw new Error("Order already refunded");
  }
  
  if (order.paymentMethod === "COD" && order.orderStatus !== "DELIVERED") {
    throw new Error("COD orders can only be refunded after delivery");
  }
  
  if (!order.paymentId) {
    throw new Error("No payment ID found for this order");
  }
};
```

### 3. Error Handling
```javascript
try {
  const refund = await razorpayService.createRefund(paymentId, amount, notes);
  // Update order status
  await updateOrderRefundStatus(orderId, refund);
} catch (error) {
  // Log error and notify admin
  console.error("Refund failed:", error);
  await notifyAdminOfRefundFailure(orderId, error.message);
}
```

## Testing Refunds

### Test Payment IDs
Use these test payment IDs in test mode:
- `pay_29QQoUBi66xm2f` - Successful refund
- `pay_29QQoUBi66xm2g` - Failed refund

### Test Refund Flow
1. Create a test order and complete payment
2. Initiate refund using the endpoint
3. Check webhook notifications
4. Verify refund status in Razorpay dashboard

## Monitoring and Reports

### 1. Refund Analytics
- Track refund rates by time period
- Monitor refund amounts vs. total sales
- Identify patterns in refund reasons

### 2. Failed Refund Alerts
- Set up alerts for failed refunds
- Implement retry mechanism for temporary failures
- Manual intervention workflow for persistent failures

## Security Considerations

### 1. Admin Authorization
- Only authenticated admins can initiate refunds
- Log all refund actions with admin user ID
- Implement approval workflow for large refunds

### 2. Webhook Security
- Verify webhook signatures
- Use HTTPS for all webhook endpoints
- Implement idempotency for webhook handling

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Payment not found"
**Solution**: Verify the payment ID exists in Razorpay dashboard

### Issue: "Insufficient balance for refund"
**Solution**: Check your Razorpay account balance and settlement status

### Issue: "Refund amount exceeds payment amount"
**Solution**: Validate refund amount doesn't exceed original payment

### Issue: "Multiple refunds on same payment"
**Solution**: Track partial refunds and ensure total doesn't exceed payment amount

## Integration with Frontend

### Admin Panel Refund Interface
```javascript
// Example frontend integration
const initiateRefund = async (orderId, refundAmount, reason) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/payment/razorpay/refund', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${adminToken}`
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        paymentId: order.paymentId,
        amount: refundAmount,
        notes: {
          reason: reason,
          orderId: orderId
        }
      })
    });
    
    const result = await response.json();
    if (result.success) {
      showSuccessMessage("Refund initiated successfully");
      refreshOrderStatus();
    }
  } catch (error) {
    showErrorMessage("Failed to initiate refund");
  }
};
```

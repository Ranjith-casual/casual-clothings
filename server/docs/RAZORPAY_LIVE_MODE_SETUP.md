## 🔥 IMPORTANT: Production Checklist

### ⚠️ CRITICAL STEPS BEFORE GOING LIVE:

#### 1. **Webhook URL Configuration**
You **MUST** update your webhook URL in Razorpay Dashboard:

1. Login to [Razorpay Dashboard](https://dashboard.razorpay.com)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Webhooks**
3. Update webhook URL to your **production domain**:
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/api/payment/razorpay/webhook
   ```
4. Enable these events:
   - `payment.captured`
   - `payment.failed` 
   - `refund.created`
   - `refund.processed`
   - `refund.failed`

#### 2. **Environment Variables Update**
Make sure your production server has the correct environment:
```bash
# Update FRONT_URL to production frontend
FRONT_URL="https://your-frontend-domain.com"

# Ensure HTTPS for webhook security
# Webhooks will ONLY work with HTTPS in live mode
```

#### 3. **Payment Methods Configuration**
In Razorpay Dashboard, enable payment methods:
- ✅ Cards (Visa, Mastercard, RuPay)
- ✅ UPI 
- ✅ Net Banking
- ✅ Wallets (Paytm, PhonePe, etc.)
- ✅ EMI (if needed)

#### 4. **Settlement Account**
- ✅ Verify your bank account is added and verified
- ✅ Check settlement schedule (daily/weekly)
- ✅ Confirm settlement fees and charges

#### 5. **KYC & Documentation**
- ✅ Complete KYC verification
- ✅ Upload required business documents
- ✅ Verify business address
- ✅ Add authorized signatories

### 🛡️ Security Measures for Live Mode:

#### **1. SSL Certificate**
```bash
# MANDATORY: Your server MUST have valid SSL certificate
# Webhooks will fail without HTTPS
```

#### **2. Webhook Security**
```javascript
// Your webhook handler already includes:
✅ Signature verification
✅ Error handling  
✅ Proper status updates
```

#### **3. Rate Limiting**
Consider implementing rate limiting for payment endpoints in production.

#### **4. Monitoring & Logging**
```javascript
// Add production monitoring for:
- Payment success rates
- Webhook delivery status  
- Failed payment alerts
- Refund processing times
```

### 🧪 Testing in Live Mode:

#### **Test with Small Amounts First**
```bash
# Start with minimal amounts to verify:
₹1 - ₹10 for initial testing
₹100 - ₹500 for thorough testing  
```

#### **Test All Payment Methods**
- ✅ Credit/Debit Cards
- ✅ UPI payments
- ✅ Net Banking
- ✅ Wallet payments

#### **Test Refund Flow**
```bash
# Test refund scenarios:
1. Immediate refund
2. Partial refund  
3. Bulk refunds
```

### 📊 Live Mode Differences:

| Feature | Test Mode | Live Mode |

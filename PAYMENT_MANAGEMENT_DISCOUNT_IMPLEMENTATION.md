# Payment Management Discount Display Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the admin payment management system to properly display discount information with product prices, providing transparency and detailed pricing breakdown for each order.

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**
- **Issue**: Admin payment management was not displaying discount information with product prices
- **Impact**: Administrators couldn't see pricing breakdowns, discount savings, or original vs discounted prices
- **Solution**: Comprehensive discount display implementation across payment management and invoice systems

- Added `originalPrice` field to bundle population

```javascript
// Before
.populate("items.productId", "name image price stock")
.populate("items.bundleId", "title image images bundlePrice stock")

// After  
.populate("items.productId", "name image price stock discount discountedPrice")
.populate("items.bundleId", "title image images bundlePrice originalPrice stock")
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Discount Calculation Priority**:
1. **Stored `discountedPrice`** (highest priority - pre-calculated from backend)
2. **Product `discount` percentage** (calculated: originalPrice × (1 - discount/100))
3. **Size-adjusted pricing** with discount application
4. **Fallback pricing** for legacy data

### **Price Sources Hierarchy**:
1. `product.discountedPrice` (from product model)
2. `product.price` with `product.discount` calculation
3. `item.sizeAdjustedPrice` for size-specific pricing
4. `item.itemTotal` for order-level pricing
5. Fallback calculations for data integrity

### **Bundle Handling**:
- Uses `bundlePrice` as final price
- Uses `originalPrice` for discount calculations
- Handles bundle-specific discount logic
- Maintains compatibility with existing bundle structure

## 🎯 **Benefits**

### **For Administrators**:
- ✅ **Complete Transparency**: See exactly how much customers saved
- ✅ **Pricing Validation**: Verify discount calculations and pricing accuracy
